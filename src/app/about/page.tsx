          <strong>I am Relina D&apos;Silva.</strong> I have spent 15+ years building brands and growth
          systems across hardware, AI, and deep-tech, often in categories where trust is earned
          slowly and lost quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work best when the problem is real, the constraints are clear, and the ambition is
          high. My focus is coherence: aligning what a business is, what it promises, and what
          people actually experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it matters, I stay close to the work. I write, shape, edit, and help teams make
          decisions that hold up outside the room.
